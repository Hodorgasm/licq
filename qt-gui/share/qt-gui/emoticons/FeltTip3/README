*** README ***

This is FeltTip Retouched, sequel to FeltTip Reprised. Why the name? Everaldo (infamous artist in the open source world), the artist who created the crystal set, once said that there were 3 tiers to icon styling: Windows, with it's cartoony look, OSX with it's heavily realistic and photographic look, and Crystal, which fits in between. One day I was thinking of trying something different, and the name that I finally came up with and liked was FeltTip, after the markers. Features of the style include the soft shapes, and thick borders. I think this makes the resulting icons really easy to look at, and gives them a clean feel.

As you can see, it's not that far off from the cartoony/crystalish look of Everaldo's artwork- actually you could say it more resembles windows style cartoony artwork. Though, I think it defines my current personal style of artwork- well, at least refined it a lot.

In the time since the original FeltTip Gaim, I've learned a lot about digital art, and feel I've improved my skills and level of polish a lot. I have to credit this to the wonderful folks over at deviantArt, they keep me inspired to cultivate the Chroma part of Chromakode.

I really enjoy emoticon creation. I'd have to say it's because of all the personality you can put into each individual piece of art. I hope that you enjoy this set!

Keep in mind you are encouraged to use these smilies in anything you wish (just don't make money off it), but please give attribution (just give credit to me). You may also modify and redistribute these smilies, incorporating them into your own work to your heart's content. Let me know, I'd love to see what you do with them! If you'd like to use these emoticons in something beyond the scope of the licence, just ask- send me an email. Chromakode@gmail.com

Included is a python script I have written to render the full set and doctor it up a little. This should work on a Linux system with ImageMagick, Inkscape, and pngcrush installed. You may also, as with the set, do what you wish with this script, heck, use it in your own emoticon set!

These emoticons were created completely using open source software on Linux. SVGs were done in Inkscape, and the final pngs were processed with the script. I reccomend Debian!

Keep on smiling.
