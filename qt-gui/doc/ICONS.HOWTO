# Icon packs are easy to make, simple create the following icons,
# and store them and the relevant <name>.icons config file in the
# icons.<name> directory.
# XPM, PNG and GIF formats are supported.  Any non-specified icons
# will be blank except event icons which will default to the basic
# message icon.
