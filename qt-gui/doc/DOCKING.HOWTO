Licq Qt-Gui Plugin
Docking Howto

Graham Roff


Docking the licq qt-gui status icon is fairly simple to do.  Here is a list
of window managers and what to do.  First, do the following:

1. Remove any old dock icons for licq.
2. Start licq and enable the dock icon in Options->Extensions->UseDockIcon
3. Select "Save Options" from the system menu.
4. Restart Licq (very important).


WindowMaker

5. Drag the status icon to the dock and voila.
Note that the other icon that appears is from windowmaker and can be set
to something nice, or disable entirely using the windowmaker menu.


AfterStep

5. Add the following to your ~/.steprc file:
   "*Wharf licq      - Swallow "LicqWharf" echo &"
6. Next time start Licq, the icon should appear in the wharf.


KDE

5. Configure licq with --with-kde and then licq will dock in the kde panel. 
6. Start Licq and there it goes!
