Requirements:

- X11 header files (xfree-devel)
- Qt 2.1 header files, Qt 2.1 lib, Qt 2.1 moc compiler
  (Qt 2.1.1 will work, Qt 2.3.1 or newer is recommended)
- Qt 3.x sort of works, but is currently not recommended  
  (a few incompatibilities have still to be resolved)

Qt can be downloaded from ftp.trolltech.com/pub/qt/source

NOTE:

if you get errors like

Unable to load plugin (qt-gui): /usr/lib/licq/licq_qt-gui.so:
+undefined symbol: dragEnterEvent__14QMultiLineEditP15QDragEnterEvent.


or similiar (text after "undefined symbol: " might vary) then you have
a older Qt 2.x lib in the paths given in /etc/ld.so.conf. uninstall them or
make sure that the Qt 2.1 lib is found first.

If you get compilation errors in a file named "*.moc", then you're using
the wrong moc compiler. you need the one shipped with your Qt 2.1 version.
NOTE some distros rename it to "moc2". use --with-qt-moc=<path>/moc2 to fix
this.

GENERAL INSTALL instructions:

READ AND UNDERSTAND ./configure --help

run

./configure <youroptionsifnecessary>
make
make install


note if you set the QTDIR environment variable to point to your Qt 2.1
installation before running ./configure, everything should run through
just fine.

Take a look at the other README's as well.

If you have a problem that is not noted here, read through the licq-main
and licq-devel mailinglist archives.
