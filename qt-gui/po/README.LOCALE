Licq Qt-GUI Translation Support


Creating a Translation File

First create the basic template by doing "make template.po".  Then rename
this file to something a bit more descriptive, such as ru.po.  Edit your
new file and fill in all the necessary translations.


Using a translation File

Once the .po file has been created, it must be converted into a Qt qm file.
This is done using the msg2qm routine, which can be invoked using 
"make <lang>.qm" assuming <lang>.po exists.  Once you have the .qm file,
simply copy it to <licq prefix>/share/licq/qt-gui/locale/<lang>.qm.  Then set
the environment variable LANGUAGE (or LANG) to the two digit language code
(as per GNU gettext standard) and it will be loaded next time the Qt-GUI
is started.  For example, to use a russian translation do:
> cd po
> make ru.qm
> cp ru.qm /usr/local/share/licq/qt-gui/locale
> export LANGUAGE="ru"


Updating a Translation File

All the text strings are updated with each new Licq release, it is necessary
to update the .po files.  This is done simply by placing the old .po file
in the po directory and running "make merge".  This simply calls the mergetr
program, which comes with Qt.  The new .po file can now be edited and any
necessary translations added.
