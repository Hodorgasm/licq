  Very easy.  For me, at least.

If you are going to be using a pre-compiled LICQ binary, e.g., RPM:

  (1) Go to http://www.troll.no and download the binary RPM for Qt 2.01.
  (2) Install the Qt RPM with the "--force" switch.
  (3) Install the LICQ RPM.

If you are going to be be compiling LICQ yourself:

  (1) Go to http://www.troll.no and download:
     (a) the binary RPM for Qt 2.01.
     (b) the devel RPM for Qt 2.01 (header files)
  (2) Remove ("rpm --erase") the Qt 1.44 devel package (devel *ONLY*)
  (3) Install the binary Qt RPM with the "--force" switch.
  (3) Install the devel Qt RPM.
  (4) Build (configure, make) and install ("make install") LICQ.

Explanation:

  The "--force" switch is required to install Qt 2.01, because there is a
single file, /usr/lib/libqt.so, which conflicts with Qt 1.44.  This file is
simply a symbolic link to the "default" Qt library.  The Linux dynamic loader
will figure out which version of the library is needed for each program
automatically.  In other words, KDE will use 1.44, LICQ will use 2.01.

  You can only have one Qt devel package installed at a time with RPM, so you
have to remove the 1.44 package before you install 2.01.  The only thing the
devel package is used for is compiling Qt applications.  I do not do that very
often to begin with, and Qt 2.01 is "mostly" source compatible with 1.44, so
problems should be few.

  If you want to have *both* Qt 1.44 and Qt 2.01 available for development,
*then* things get a little hairy.  But most people do not care.  :)

  Hope this helps!
