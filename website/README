      LICQ v1.3.0 README

      #Licq on irc.freenode.net

Please check doc/ for the older README which has detailed instructions!

It has been over a year since the last version of Licq has been released. So what took so long? Well, now there is support for multiple protocols if you wish to use them.  Currently only MSN and ICQ/AIM are supported. This involved a rewrite of many parts so a lot of work has been put into this version.

Enjoy this long awaited release and feel free to come by #Licq! We could use some more people there, we get lonely :)
