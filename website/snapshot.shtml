If you want to participate development and get full CVS access, please ask <a href="mailto:jon@licq.org">Jon</a>.</div>
<p>If you want to know what has changed in every detail, you should subscribe to the Licq CVS commit mailinglist.To do so, write an email to <a href= "mailto:licq-cvs-request@lists.sourceforge.net">licq-cvs-request@lists.sourceforge.net</a> and put 'subscribe' in the subject.</p>

<p>
<div align="justify">
You can download the current Licq snapshot <a href="licq-daily.tar.bz2">licq-20041015</a>.<br>
<p>Remember, these are development versions, so they might have new and untested features or contain bugs. They might not even compile, so use them at your own risk.
<p>Please join the Licq development mailinglist when you use the snapshots regularly.
You should report problems with the snapshots or
discuss feature requests / patches there. To subscribe, write an email to <a href="mailto:licq-devel-request@lists.sourceforge.net">licq-devel-request@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.</div><p>If there is a problem with the snapshot itself, please tell <a href="mailto:jon@licq.org">me</a>. <hr>
<p><h2>Anonymous CVS</h2>
<div align="justify">Thanks to Billy Biggs, there is now an anonymous CVS server available. Which is now being kept on SourceForge.
The anonymous CVS server is read-only. If you have installed the cvs binary,
you can use it to easily keep up to date with bleeding edge Licq development. This is 
<b>only</b> intended for those who have at least basic knowledge in CVS usage
or those who want to figure it out on their own. All others are strongly recommended to use
the regularly generated CVS snapshots. See above for details.
<p>Login to the anonymous CVS server by typing
<pre>
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/licq login
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/licq co &lt;modulename&gt;
</pre>the requested password is empty, just type return.<p>You can checkout the following modules:
<ul><li>licq</li>
<li>licq-data</li>
<li>licq-plugins</li>
</ul>
You have to run <pre>make -f Makefile.cvs</pre> to generate the ./configure script needed for compiling the source. You need automake 1.4 or later installed to succeed.<br>
 The recommended ~/.cvsrc for CVS usage is:<pre>cvs -l -z4 -q
diff -u1 -b -p
update -dP
checkout -P
</pre></div>If you experience any unusual problems, please inform me.<hr>
