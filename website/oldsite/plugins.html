Plugins form a fundamental layer in the Licq architecture.  They communicate with
the Licq daemon to allow user interfaces and other functions to be built.  Creating
a plugin is fairly tricky as there is little documentation and the daemon interface
is somewhat complicated.  A good place to start is the <A HREF="PLUGINS.HOWTO">PLUGINS.HOWTO</A>, and the Licq
header files.
<P>
Installing a plugin is, however, simple.  First, unpack the plugin to the "plugins"
directory in the main Licq source tree.  Then build and install it (ie place it in
/usr/local/lib/licq).  Then run licq using the "-p" option
and the name of the plugin (minus the leading "licq_" and tailing ".so").  For
example, the qt-gui plugin may be loaded by doing<BR>
licq -p qt-gui<BR>
where the plugin has been installed as /usr/local/lib/licq/licq_qt-gui.so.
<P>
After the first time, any plugins will load automatically at startup without the need for
the -p option.
<P>
A number of plugins are available for Licq at the current time:

<TR BGCOLOR="#555555"><TD>Qt GUI
    <TD>1.2.7
    <TD>The offical interface for Licq written in Qt.  Comes with the main distribution.

    <TD>1.2.7
    <TD>This is a console interface plugin for Licq using ncurses.  It features multiple
        command windows, and much of the basic icq functionality.  It can be retrieved
        using CVS as described in the <A HREF="http://www.rhrk.uni-kl.de/~dmuell/licq">Licq cvs page</A>,
        the module is called "console".

    <TD>0.1.6
    <TD>This is apparently some basic code heading towards a gnome plugin for Licq.  It's
        there only for developers to play and see what they can do.  If anyone comes
        up with enough improvements to warrent a CVS tree then I will make one.
<TR BGCOLOR="#777777"><TD><A HREF="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jkstrick/licq_gtk-gui.tar.gz">GTK+ Gui (2)</A>
    <TD>0
    <TD>"I'm working on a gtk plugin for Licq.  It's not usable yet, but it's a
    definite start.  If you would like to include the tarball in your
    plugins section of the webpage that would help me out, b/c this is my
    first attempt at a somewhat organized programming project, and some
    input from people who know that the plugin exists would be nice."<BR>

<TR BGCOLOR="#555555"><TD>Forwarder
    <TD>1.0
    <TD>A simple plugin to forward incoming ICQ events to either an email address
        or another ICQ account.  This is great for forwarding a secondary ICQ account
        or forwarding to a pager/mobile phone.  Also included in the main distribution.
<TR BGCOLOR="#777777"><TD>Auto-Responder
    <TD>1.0
    <TD>Plugin to automatically respond to any incoming event with the output
        of a given program, which can be passed user arguments, or event the
        message text itself.  Often used in conjunction with "fortune" to send
        people fortunes.  Also included in the main distribution.
<TR BGCOLOR="#555555"><TD>Update Hosts
    <TD>0.0.5
    <TD>A simple plugin to add your contact list to your /etc/hosts file, thus allowing
        the use of a users alias as a hostname for contacting them using ftp/telnet/talk...
        The plugin can be run concurrently with a gui plugin and will dynamically
        maintain your /etc/hosts file as users go online and offline.<BR>
        Can be found on the ftp site (ftp.xx.licq.org) in the plugins directory.
<TR BGCOLOR="#555555"><TD><A HREF="http://www.esquadro.com.br/~ismore/mailchecker-0.5.tar.gz">Mailchecker</A>
    <TD>1.0
    <TD>This is a POP3 plugin and was created to notify the user when there is mail on your server.
        There are some bugs but the author is working to resolve them.  Please notify the contributer of problems.<BR>
        Contributed by Ismael Orenstein &lt;perdig@linuxbr.com.br&gt;
<TR BGCOLOR="#777777"><TD>Remote Management Service</A>
    <TD>0.30
    <TD>This plugin opens a TCP server on the Licq box which allows you to
        telnet in and perform commands and get information.  It acts much
        like the FIFO only is two way.  It is designed to be used to develop
        Perl bindings for Licq to be used in html documents, but is easily
        used interactively.  Currently it supports viewing/changing status,
        viewing the user list, viewing groups, sending messages/urls, and
        dumping the network log.<BR>
        Basic security is implemented through the need to enter your UIN and
        ICQ password before being allowed access to commands.<BR>
        Written by Graham Roff.  New enhancements by Jon Keating.
