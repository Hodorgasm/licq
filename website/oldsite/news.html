	Thanks to Billy Biggs, there is now an anonymous CVS server available.
	The anonymous CVS server is read-only. If you have installed the cvs

	development. This is only intended for those who have at least basic
	knowledge in CVS usage or those who want to figure it out on their own.
	All others are strongly recommended to use the regularly generated CVS
	snapshots.<BR>

	I would like to regretfully announce that Graham Roff, one of the
	original creators of the LICQ project, will no longer be an active
	participant in the project.  It is his wish to continue with his career
	and we who remain in the project want to wish him the best.  Thank you
	Graham for all your efforts and dedication in developing a wonderful ICQ
	for UNIX.<BR>
	<BR>
	Secondly let me say that we are proud to announce the development that is
	being done on the ICQ Version 8 protocol.  This has been numbered as
	v1.1.0 of LICQ while it is in beta and only available through the CVS
	repository.  Thanks to the developers and contributers to the project we
	have seen a lot of advances in a very short time towards this goal.  I
	would like to caution everyone who try the CVS version that there are
	inherent bugs with the new program.  It is recommended that you read
	through the newsgroup archives before posting.<BR>
	<BR>
	I would also like to announce that we have lost the Polish LICQ Mirror.
	I would like to thank Michal Margula for his participation and
	assistance and everything else he has done for the LICQ project.<BR>

        New release mainly fixes bugs, with a few new features including

        Ability to send and receive color messages like icq99.<BR>
        Added a new dock theme which should work well with the kde dock (it's much

        The RMS plugin also now finally uses a config file which allows

        Next beta heading towards 0.85.  Some fixes for chat and file transfer.
        Big new feature as well.  Now Licq clients can establish secure tcp
        connections to one another using Diffie/Hellman key exchange and then
        send totally secure messages/urls/chat requests...to one another encrypted
        using DES XCBC encryption (all based on <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org" TARGET="_top">OpenSSL</A>).
        Anyone listening in won't even be able to
        tell that they are ICQ communication packets.  Only works between
        Licq clients as Mirabilis does not support any form of secure encryption.<BR>

        This release is a beta of the upcoming version 0.85.  It has loads of
        new features and fixes include (but not limited to):<BR>
        <UL>
        <LI>Totally new Qt-gui user window design (which may not make everyone happy, but
        that's life).  More usable and logically laid out.
        <LI>Support for ICQ TCP protocols version 4,5,6 and 7.  This means no
        more problems with messages &gt; 450 characters, or errors about using
        a client that doesn't support certain features.
        <LI>User filters for your auto response (using % commands).  This means
        your auto response could be "Sorry &lt;alias&gt;, I'm not here" for
        example, just using a simple "%a".
        <LI>Multiple recipient support.  Send a message/url to multiple people
        using an easy drag'n'drop interface.
        <LI>Full support for sending contacts.
        <LI>Support for per-user customized auto responses.
        <LI>Lots more too, I forget what else...
        </UL>
        <BR>
        Note this release requires Qt 2.1, and no binaries will be made of
        the pre-0.85 beta releases.
        <BR><BR>
        There is a new plugin as well called the Remote Management Server (RMS).
        It allows you to telnet to your Licq client and perform simple remote
        maintenance things like view your list, send messages/urls, change
        status...all interactively.  Please see the <A HREF="plugins.html">plugins page</A> for more
        details.<BR>
        This plugin is designed to be an interface for writing Perl bindings for
        Licq.  It shouldn't be too hard if you know a little about writing Perl
        bindings and Perl network I/O, but I do not...someone more skilled then
        I please help me out.  The end goal is the ability to use cgi perl
        scripts to be able to display Licq user information as a web page.

                          an RPM of it, I build from source.
                          </UL>
                          A bug fix release (0.81) will probably come out in a week or so
                          after all other minor bugs have been tracked down.<BR>
                          And to everyone who has complained and expressed anger at the RPM
                          being built against Qt 2.1 and all other believed issues in this
                          release, f*ck you.  I'm doing this all for FREE if your simple
                          mind hasn't clued in on that yet.  You
                          can always just stick with a previous version if you don't like it.
