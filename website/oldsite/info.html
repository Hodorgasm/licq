Licq is a multi-threaded ICQ clone written mostly in C++.  It uses an extensive plugin system
to manage many different functions.  The main gui is written using the Qt widget set.
Licq is distributed under GPL with some special QPL exceptions for Qt.<P>
Development is very ongoing, with new features and bugs fixed frequently, so updates are available often.
The current version should be very stable, but as with all software use it at your own risk.
<BR>

See the <A HREF="README">README</A> or <A HREF="faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</A> for more information.<P>
Get the current stable release <A HREF="download.html">here</A>.<P>

See the <A HREF="TODO">TODO</A> file for more info about upcoming improvements, and <A
HREF="BUGS">BUGS</A> for known problems.<P>

<HR>

<H2>Requirements</H2><P>
<UL>
<LI><B>POSIX thread (pthreads) final draft support</B>.  Most operating systems support
    pthreads natively, however FreeBSD in particular does not completely support
    the final draft.  To build using FreeBSD, see the README.FREEBSD file included in the
    main distribution.
<LI><B>Thread-safe X11 libraries</B>.  Again, most operating systems have no problem with
    this, but if you are using libc5 under Linux (ie you get "Fatal IO Error" when starting
    Licq) you will have to make sure that
    you are using thread-safe libraries (see <A HREF="http://www.xmms.org/faq.html#r2" TARGET="_top">www.xmms.org</A>).
<LI><B>Qt 3.0</B> (libraries and developement headers).  Check out <A HREF="http://www.troll.no" TARGET="_top">
    http://www.troll.no</A> for more information.  This is only required if you
    want to use the Qt gui plugin (recommended).
<LI><B>C++</B>.  A c++ compiler and libstdc++ plus c++ headers are also required.
<LI><B>GNU Make</B>.  Comes with BSD and Linux, others will have to install it.
</UL>
<BR>
RPM users will need to ensure the following packages are installed:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>qt (3.0 or greater)
<LI>libstdc++
<LI>gcc-c++
<LI>openssl (0.9.5a or greater)
</UL>
Additionally if you are compiling from source you will need:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>qt-devel
<LI>libstdc++-devel
<LI>XFree86-devel
