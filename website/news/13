Vacation
I am going on vacation until May 8th, so please
do not flood my mailbox with urgent requests as they will be ignored
for weeks to come.  The mailing list continues to operate and there
are a number of people involved there who can assist with any problems.<BR>
The latest cvs tree has a number of bug fixes and a brand new GUI
message sending/viewing interface.  Dirk and I really like it, but
welcome any feature requests or bug reports.  Take a look, let us
know what you like/dislike.<BR>
We need good looking icons the history and info buttons still, so
if anyone has artistic talent and some spare time...
