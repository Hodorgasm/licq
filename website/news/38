Licq 1.2.4
At the Super Bowl Halftime show, Licq 1.2.4 was released. The ChangeLog has been updated, so check it out. Unfortunately, the Licq Project was $1,999,994.31 short of purchasing a commercial to announce the release during the Super Bowl. Perhaps next year. Some features of this release are:<BR>

<LI>New skin/icon broswer.
<LI>Threading issues cleaned up.
<LI>Accepting batch file tranfsers from Miranda works now.
