Licq 1.2.6
Finally a new release that has lots of new features and bug fixes.  Makes you want to upgrade and suggest more features and find new bugs to fix, doesn't it?<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Option to not save the password in the config file.  To enable this feature, go to Menu -> System Functions -> Security/Password Options and delete your password out of the editable text boxes and press OK.
<LI>Improvement with batch file transfers.
<LI>Fixes the cancelling of an event to not automatically be sent if "Auto send through server" is enabled.  Instead it will check the "Send through server" checkbox.  This allows you to edit the message when you click Cancel, as expected.
<LI>Skin fixes for Qt-GUI, including a new skin and icon set titled "thomas"
<LI>Skins may be installed in the Licq base directory (~/.licq/qt-gui/).  No more needing to be root for a skin!
<LI>Save sent SMS in the user's history.
<LI>Send SMS via the Licq FIFO.
<LI>Simple server side contact group management.
<LI>Check away messages through the server unless you are already connected to that user.
<LI>Improved proxy support.
<LI>Automatically load other plugins by default if Qt-GUI is not installed.
<LI>Debian Sid compilation fix.
<LI>New Finnish translation.
<LI>Some more bug fixes, the usual.
</UL>

Have fun with 1.2.6!
