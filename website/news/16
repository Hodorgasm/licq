Licq 0.84b (beta release)
Next beta heading towards 0.85.  Some fixes for chat and file transfer.
Big new feature as well.  Now Licq clients can establish secure tcp
connections to one another using Diffie/Hellman key exchange and then
send totally secure messages/urls/chat requests...to one another encrypted
using DES XCBC encryption (all based on <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org" TARGET="_top">OpenSSL</A>).
Anyone listening in won't even be able to
tell that they are ICQ communication packets.  Only works between
Licq clients as Mirabilis does not support any form of secure encryption.
