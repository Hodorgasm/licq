Licq CVS Update Announcement
Thanks to Billy Biggs, there is now an anonymous CVS server available.
The anonymous CVS server is read-only. If you have installed the cvs
binary, you can use it to easily keep up to date with bleeding edge Licq
development. This is only intended for those who have at least basic
knowledge in CVS usage or those who want to figure it out on their own.
All others are strongly recommended to use the regularly generated CVS
snapshots.
