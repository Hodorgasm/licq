Release Update
Problems problems problems.  First of all, Licq 0.80 is perfectly
stable and works great.  Anyone having problems is just not understanding
certain aspects of the situation.  Here are some common problems
and the solutions:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Word wrap doesn't work - upgrade to Qt 2.1 (beta 3).  Word
wrap never really worked in Qt 2.0, I just used a cheap hack
which is no longer supported.
<LI>unresolved symbol: __ti10INetSocket - Edit src/Makefile and
src/daemon/Makefile and remove all occurences of "-fno-rtti"
and then recompile the daemon and it will work.
<LI>Segfault when selecting options - you have to rebuild the
Qt-gui plugin as well as the daemon.  This is the problem for
sure, so don't email me claiming you already did.
<LI>Unresolved Qt symbols - if you are using the RPM then you
will need Qt 2.1 beta 3.  Upgrade.  No, I do not know where to find
an RPM of it, I build from source.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
A bug fix release (0.81) will probably come out in a week or so
after all other minor bugs have been tracked down.<BR>
And to everyone who has complained and expressed anger at the RPM
being built against Qt 2.1 and all other believed issues in this
release, f*ck you.  I'm doing this all for FREE if your simple
mind hasn't clued in on that yet.  You
can always just stick with a previous version if you don't like it.
