Licq 1.0.1
New release mainly fixes bugs, with a few new features including
search online users only, full KDE2 support, auto response scripting
support (start a line in the auto response with a '|' and that line
will be executed and replaced with the output).<BR>
Ability to send and receive color messages like icq99.<BR>
Added a new dock theme which should work well with the kde dock (it's much
smaller then the other ones.<BR>
The RMS plugin also now finally uses a config file which allows
specifying the port to use.<BR>
The licq converter for icq99b works with icq2000 as well and has been
suitably renamed.  See the download section to get it.<BR>
Updated the <A HREF="faq.php">faq</A> with some suggestions on problems logging on if
you also use icq2000 (question 3.11).
