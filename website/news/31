Licq and Mirror Update Announcement
I would like to regretfully announce that Graham Roff, one of the
original creators of the Licq project, will no longer be an active
participant in the project.  It is his wish to continue with his career
and we who remain in the project want to wish him the best.  Thank you
Graham for all your efforts and dedication in developing a wonderful ICQ
for UNIX.<BR>

Secondly let me say that we are proud to announce the development that is
being done on the ICQ Version 8 protocol.  This has been numbered as
v1.1.0 of Licq while it is in beta and only available through the CVS
repository.  Thanks to the developers and contributers to the project we
have seen a lot of advances in a very short time towards this goal.  I
would like to caution everyone who try the CVS version that there are
inherent bugs with the new program.  It is recommended that you read
through the newsgroup archives before posting.<BR>

I would also like to announce that we have lost the Polish Licq Mirror.
I would like to thank Michal Margula for his participation and
assistance and everything else he has done for the Licq project.
