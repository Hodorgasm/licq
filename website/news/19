Updated Auto-Reply Plugin
The program used to
auto generate the reply can now be passed user arguments such as the
alias, uin etc...It can also have the event text itself be passed to
the standard input of the program.<BR>
This allows for basically limitless customizability of the response
based on the user and the sent text.
