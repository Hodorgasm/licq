Licq 0.81
This is a small bug fix and feature release.  Please note
that Licq essentially requires Qt 2.1 beta 3 in order to function as
expected.  Earlier version of Qt may work, but behavior is not guaranteed.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Configure problem fixed, memory should be reduced, and problems about
unresolved symbols removed.
<LI>Added Popup All Messages menu option which will pop up the function
window for users with messages.
<LI>Added some more keyboard shortcuts to the main window:  <I>Ctrl-P</I> for Popup
All Messages, <I>Delete</I> to remove a user from the current group, <I>Ctrl-Delete</I> to
remove a user from the contact list, <I>Ctrl-O</I> to toggle showing offline users.
<LI>Holding control while clicking on close in a function window will now
delete the relevant user from the contact list.  Very useful for quickly killing
spammers.
<LI>Chat window no longers dissappears when changing desktops.
<LI>Certain history files no longer crash the Qt-GUI plugin.
</UL>
</P>
<P>
Added two new dock themes, one of which (glicq) is perfect for the gnome panel.<BR>
Thanks to everyone who expressed gratitude for the effort myself and the other
Licq developers have gone to to develop this program.  I really do appreciate
it.<BR>
