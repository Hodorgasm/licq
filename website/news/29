Mirror Update Announcement
Well I finally got around to removing the Australian Mirror links.  I
was informed last month that the mirror had to be removed but never had
the time to do it.  Darryl Ross indicated that the ISP the mirror was
hosted with closed down their network.  Thank you for your help Darryl.
