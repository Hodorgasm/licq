Licq 0.84a (beta release)
        This release is a beta of the upcoming version 0.85.  It has loads of
        new features and fixes include (but not limited to):<BR>
        <UL>

        <LI>Totally new Qt-gui user window design (which may not make everyone happy, but
        that's life).  More usable and logically laid out.
        <LI>Support for ICQ TCP protocols version 4,5,6 and 7.  This means no
        more problems with messages &gt; 450 characters, or errors about using
        a client that doesn't support certain features.
        <LI>User filters for your auto response (using % commands).  This means
        your auto response could be "Sorry &lt;alias&gt;, I'm not here" for
        example, just using a simple "%a".
        <LI>Multiple recipient support.  Send a message/url to multiple people
        using an easy drag'n'drop interface.
        <LI>Full support for sending contacts.
        <LI>Support for per-user customized auto responses.
        <LI>Lots more too, I forget what else...
        </UL>
        </P>
        <P>
        <BR>
        Note this release requires Qt 2.1, and no binaries will be made of
        the pre-0.85 beta releases.
        <BR><BR>

        There is a new plugin as well called the Remote Management Server (RMS).
        It allows you to telnet to your Licq client and perform simple remote
        maintenance things like view your list, send messages/urls, change
        status...all interactively.  Please see the <A HREF="plugins.html">plugins page</A> for more
        details.<BR>
        This plugin is designed to be an interface for writing Perl bindings for
        Licq.  It shouldn't be too hard if you know a little about writing Perl
        bindings and Perl network I/O, but I do not...someone more skilled then
        I please help me out.  The end goal is the ability to use cgi perl
        scripts to be able to display Licq user information as a web page.
