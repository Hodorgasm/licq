Basic Installation of Qt4-GUI Plugin for Licq
=============================================

Requirements for Qt4-GUI:

  - X11 header files (xfree-devel or xorg-devel)
  - Qt 4.3.2 or greater. Most distributions come with packages like Qt and
    Qt-devel, you need both, please install the missing ones!
  - A C++ compiler and libstc++-devel.  This compiler must be the same
          version that was used to compile Qt with.  If it is not, you will
          probably experience a crash on startup.
  - cmake 2.4.2 or greater.
  - GNU make

Qt can be downloaded from ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/pub/qt/source
(search for qt-x11-opensource-src-X.X.X.tar.gz).


These are the installation instructions:

  1. Go to the directory where you unpacked Qt4-GUI sources and create
     the new directory named build. Go into that directory and type
     'cmake ..' (without quotes).
     This will check for required components and create the build tree
     along with needed Makefiles. While running, it prints some messages
     telling which features it is checking for. If you want KDE support,
     please read README.KDE.

  2. Type 'make' to compile the package.

  3. Type 'make install' to install the plugin, data files and
     documentation. You have to be 'root' for this to work.
     Per default files are installed with /usr/local prefix.
