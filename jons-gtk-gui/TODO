Stuff on the top has a higher priority

* Sending multi-recipient messages.

* Sending contacts.

* Pretty up the file window (the one that shows the stats)

* Add some buttons to the conversation window, to send a url, chat, file,
  read their info, history, and anything else worthwhile.

* Add in icon themes and maybe sound themes.

* SOCKS5 Configuration and lots of other options

* Release it eventually...
