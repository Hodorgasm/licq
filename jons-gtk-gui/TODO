Stuff on the top has a higher priority

* There may be a memory leak involving viewing histories.  Or if you open
  a large file it may just take up too much memory.  Needs to be looked into.
  I've had the licq process get as high as 20M.. yuck.

* Fix updating the owner's info..  I don't think you can even update your
  nick..  Haven't messed around with that in awhile.

* Sending multi-recipient messages.

* Changing from my option file to use the class that is in licq.. CIniFile I
  think.

* Sending contacts.

* Pretty up the file window (the one that shows the stats)

* Add some buttons to the conversation window, to send a url, chat, file,
  read their info, history, and anything else worthwhile.

* Add in icon themes or packs, whatever they're called.

* SOCKS5 Configuration and lots of other options

* Release it eventually...
