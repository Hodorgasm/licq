To install the cvs version
==========================

src/Makefile.am will need to be edited to include the proper licq header files.. I will fix this soon, but right now I'm more worried about adding more features in.

run these commands in this order:
aclocal
autoheader
autoconf
automake
./configure
make

The make file will give an error.. that's ok, just cp src/licq_gtk.so /usr/local/lib/licq and that takes care of it...  This will also be fixed when I make the configure script smarter and all that nice stuff to make it easy.
