Licq D-Bus Interface plugin
===========================

DESCRIPTION

This plugin adds support for remote monitoring and control of Licq via D-Bus.
Signals are sent for incoming messages, contact list and basic user information
can be queried and status can be changed.

The name org.licq is registered on the session bus.


QUICK INSTALLATION

Dependencies for D-Bus plugin:
- Licq, including dependencies needed to build Licq
- libdbus 1.0.0 or later

Build and install:
# mkdir build && cd build
# cmake ..
# make
# make install

The plugin will be called "dbus" and has no parameters or configuration file.


METHOD CALLS

Get Licq version:
# dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/Core org.licq.Core.GetVersion

Terminate Licq:
# dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/Core org.licq.Core.Shutdown

Get list of accounts:
Returns an array of strings where each string is the protocol name followed by
a slash and the user id of an account.
# dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/ContactList org.licq.ContactList.GetAccounts

Get list of contacts for an account:
Returns an array of string where each string is the user id of a contact.
# dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/ContactList/ICQ/12345678 org.licq.Account.GetContacts

Get current status for an account or contact:
Returns bitmask of status flags and a user readable string. Note that the
string may be translated and should not be relied on in code logic.
For bitmask values, see StatusFlags in include/licq/contactlist/user.h.
# dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/ContactList/ICQ/12345678 org.licq.Account.GetStatus
# dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/ContactList/ICQ/12345678/87654321 org.licq.Contact.GetStatus

Get basic information for an account or contact:
Returns four strings: Alias, first name, last name, and email.
# dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/ContactList/ICQ/12345678 org.licq.Account.GetName
# dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/ContactList/ICQ/12345678/87654321 org.licq.Contact.GetName

Set current status for an account:
# dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/ContactList/ICQ/12345678 org.licq.Account.SetStatus string:away
# dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.licq /org/licq/ContactList/ICQ/12345678 org.licq.Account.SetStatus uint32:1024


SIGNALS

Receiving signals:
# dbus-monitor "type='signal',sender='org.licq'"

Signals are emitted for status changes, received messages, and the number of
unread messages.
Object paths and interfaces are the same as for the method calls above.

The following methods are used in signals:
Status          - Emitted for accounts and contacts when status changes.
                  Parameters are bitmask status and string as for GetStatus
                  above
NumUnread       - Emitted for ContactList with a single unsigned parameter
                  telling the current number of unread events.
NumUnread       - Emitted for accounts and contacts. One unsigned parameter
                  tells the current number of unread events for the contact.
                  A second string parameter with the contact's display name is
                  also included for convenience.
ReceivedEvent   - Emitted for accounts and contacts when an event is received
                  Two string parameters contains the event message and the
                  contact's display name.
Started         - Emitted for Core when Licq has registered with D-Bus.
Shutdown        - Emitted for Core when Licq is about to terminate.


ENCODING

All strings are encoded as UTF-8.
However, user ids of accounts and contacts that contains characters other than
[0-9A-Za-z] must be converted when used in object paths by replacing each byte
with an underscore followed by two hex digits. (This is similair to how % is
used in URIs.) For example, the MSN account test@example.com can be accessed
using the following object path: /org/licq/ContactList/MSN/test_40example_2Ecom
