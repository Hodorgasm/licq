Subject: Re: [Licq-main] Connection problem - there is hope i got it 

hi
i have a simple sort of effective system working 
i have pretty much exactlly the same system, the answer is to pipe the udp as
ics dont like udp connectins from linux icq clients (is this a war or what)
abc

a) go to cnet downloads and search for a
udp tunnel proggie for win i found pppshar (shareware but no timebomb) to be
the best easyest download it (win) in the folder there is a settings.ini file
and down the bottem add

#icq
service=icq1
map=udp
host-icq.mirabilis.com
listen=4
remote=4000
enable=yes

tb)hen in your licq config file set the number of servers to 1 and the default
port to 4 and change server 1 from icq.miribilis.com to <ipofyouricsserver>
save it 

c)run pppshar then run licq

messages and url's gothrough the udp pipe and file chat etc go through the
server. it took me about a month to get it working but once i did this i had it
up in 10 mins lucky guess i guess.. :-)

e-mail me with any probs 

alex

btw
makers of licq  - u may want to add somthing lto this effect to the doc/
dir as i have had many friends do the same thing.
