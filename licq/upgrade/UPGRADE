Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

Upgrading from 0.70 to 0.71
1.  Backup your .licq directory (just in case)
2.  Run "upgrade-0.70-0.71-users.sh"
3.  Run "upgrade-0.70-0.71-history.pl"


Upgrading from 0.61 to 0.70
1.  Backup your .licq directory, erase or move it, and then
    reinstall from scratch.  Once that's done you can copy the following files:
    Old file                       New File
    ~/.licq/conf/users.conf        ~/.licq/users.conf
		~/.licq/conf/owner.uin         ~/.licq/owner.uin
    ~/.licq/conf/*.uin             ~/.licq/users/*.uin
2.  Load up Licq and set any other options using the Options dialog box


Upgrading from 0.60 to 0.61
1.  Nothing special needs to be done.


Upgrading from 0.51 to 0.60
1.  Lots has changed, so bear with me as I might forget stuff.
2.  Add the following key to licq.conf:
    [network]
    UrlViewer = viewurl-netscape.sh
3.  Grab viewurl-netscape.sh from the contrib/ directory and put it somewhere
    in your path.
4.  Take note that the command line option to set the debug level is totally
    different now.  Licq -h will tell you more.
5.  A bunch of warnings will be spit out about Authorization for every user
    file you have.  They can be ignored, except for owner.uin where you will
    have to add Authorization = 0 (or 1, it's boolean).


Upgrading from 0.50 alpha 3 to 0.51

1.  Note that Licq no longer uses Imlib.
2.  Add to the color section in licq.conf 
    ColorGridLines = black (or whatever).
3.  Add to the [user] section in owner.uin
    Authorization = 0 or 1 depending on whether or not people
    need your authorization to add you.
4.  The first time you run it, you will get a bunch of
    warnings about missing stuff in user files, just
    ignore them and do "Save All Users".


Upgrading from 0.50 alpha 2 to alpha 3

1.  Edit licq.conf and add in the [network] section
    MaxUsersPerPacket = 125.
2.  If it really bothers you, change the Sex field
    in all the .uin files to be 0 for Unknown, 1 for
    female, or 2 for male.  These will gradually get
    fixed automatically as you update detail info
    in any case.


Upgrading from 0.50 alpha 1 to alpha 2

1.  Nothing to do...just install the binary.


Upgrading from 0.44 to 0.50

1.  Basically you are going to have to scrap
    everything because a lot has changed.
2.  Back up your users.conf file in ~/.licq/conf.
3.  Unpack misc/licq-base.tar.gz into ~/.licq.
4.  Copy your users.conf file back into ~/.licq/conf.
5.  Edit ~/.licq/conf/owner.uin and enter your personal
    info.
6.  The first time you start up licq it will complain
    about all your users missing info.  Select Save
    All Users from the System menu and it should work
    fine the next time you start it.


Upgrading from 0.43 to 0.44

1.  Make sure your sound files in licq.conf point
    to the full pathname of the file.  This was 
    changed in 0.43 actually.
2.  Nothing else to do.


Upgrading from 0.42 to 0.43

1.  Edit licq.conf and add "ShowHeader = 1" to the 
    [appearance] section.
2.  Change all the ColorOnlineBack = whatever to just
    ColorBackground = whatever in the [appearance]
    section.  ie, is now only one background setting,
    called ColorBackground.

1.  Nothing fancy to do, just reinstall the binary.


Upgrading from 0.40 final to 0.41

1.  cp -r /usr/local/share/Licq/translations/ ~/.licq/
2.  Edit your licq.conf file and add the following keys
    [network]:
    # Translation Tables from ~/.licq/translations/
    # none = do not use any translation
    # anything else = use the relevant file for translations
    Translation = none
    [sound]
    OnlineNotify = notify.wav
    [startup]
    # number of minutes before automatically going away and NA, or 0 to disable
    AutoAway = 5
    AutoNA = 10   
3.  Backup all your user (*.uin) files just in case.
4.  Run the following commands (assuming your installation dir is ~/.licq):

3.  Copy the new licq.conf file from /usr/local/share/Licq/conf

    password.  Then have a look at all the new options and set
    them up the way you want.
