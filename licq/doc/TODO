List of things to do and in progress for Licq:
o  Server side contact fixes (by me)
o  v7/v8 client communication (almost complete)
o  Any (valid) bug listed on SF.  It would be best to talk with me first if
   you decide to fix one of these, as I probably know what is wrong and what
   to do to fix it.

Other Things:
o  Have licq automatically detect the status of ppp0 and go online/offline
   accordingly
o  Fix auto-update all users
o  Auto accept file option
o  Batch file transfers
o  Viewing user info without adding user to list
o  Intelligent adding of sms phone numbers to a user's info.  No more forcing
   the user to know how to enter the phone number for it to work properly.

Plugin Ideas:
o  Email checker (what happened to the mailchecker plugin?)
o  Web server
