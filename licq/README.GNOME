  Are you by any chance running GNOME?  GNOME has an interesting "feature"
where its session management blindly assumes that every program not explicitly
excluded supports GNOME session management.  The next time you log in, GNOME
then passes a "-session" argument to LICQ.  The "i" in session gets
interpreted as "force initialization", blowing away your old config.

  Solution?  Open the "GNOME Control Center".  Go to "Startup Programs".  Add
LICQ to the "Non-session-managed Startup Programs".  Alternatively, close
LICQ, and go to the "Save Session Now" option under GNOME's "Settings" menu.
For either path, be sure not to check the 'Save session" checkbox when you log
out of GNOME.

  Hope this helps!
